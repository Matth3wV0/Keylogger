![Game](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/642b780e-9e48-4770-b725-638c23f6db8a)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how a keylogger can be embedded within a seemingly harmless Snake game to capture and exfiltrate sensitive data from a victim's machine. The demo showcases the techniques used to hide the malicious code, capture input data, and send it to an attacker via Telegram.

## How It Works

1. **Phising the victim through MAIL**
   - The keylogger code is injected into the Snake game, designed to start capturing keystrokes as soon as the game begins.

2. **Running the Game:**
   - The victim plays the Snake game without realizing that their inputs are being recorded.

3. **Capturing and Exfiltrating Data:**
   - The captured keystrokes are stored.

   - Password stored in Google Chrome also be stealed.

3. **Adding Keylogger to Startup**
   - To ensure persistence, the keylogger script is added to the startup folder, making it execute each time the victimâ€™s system is restarted.

5. **Data Transmission:**
   - The data is sent securely and stealthily to the attacker's Telegram bot, and ensuring the attacker receives the information without the victim's knowledge.
