# Snake Game Keylogger - Hidden Threat Demo

![Snake Game Keylogger](path/to/your/image.jpg)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how a keylogger can be embedded within a seemingly harmless Snake game to capture and exfiltrate sensitive data from a victim's machine. The demo showcases the techniques used to hide the malicious code, capture input data, and send it to an attacker via a secure communication channel.

## How It Works

1. **Embedding the Keylogger:**
   - The keylogger code is injected into the Snake game, designed to start capturing keystrokes as soon as the game begins.

2. **Running the Game:**
   - The victim plays the Snake game without realizing that their inputs are being recorded.

3. **Capturing and Exfiltrating Data:**
   - The captured keystrokes are stored and then transmitted to the attacker's Telegram bot.

4. **Data Transmission:**
   - The data is sent securely and stealthily, ensuring the attacker receives the information without the victim's knowledge.
